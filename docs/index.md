### Program submission
Confirm below applies to UK too:
AP Computer Science Principles: April 30, 2026 (11:59 p.m. ET), is the deadline for students to submit their Create performance task as final. 

Aim to submit earlier than deadling to reduce risk of web site crashes if busy 


#### Rubrics
Video with captions (1 minute max) that demonstrates:
- Input
- Program functionality
- Output

#### Prompts
- Purpose of the program
- Functionality of the program
- Description of input shown in video
- Description of output shown in video


#### Screnshots 1
Take screenshots of two program code segments
- One that shows how data has been stored in the list
- One that shws the data in this list being used to fulfil progrma purpose


#### Questions 1
Answer in total of 200 words:
- Name of the list
- Describe what the data contained in the list represent in your program.
- Explain how the selected list manages complexity in your program code by explaining why your program code could not be written, or how it would be written differently, if you did not use the list. 

#### Screnshots 2

Screenshots of two program code segments: 
One showing a student-developed procedure that: 

- Defines the procedure's name and return type (if necessary). 

- Contains and uses at least one parameter that has an effect on the functionality of the procedure. 

- Implements an algorithm that includes and executes: 
Sequencing 
Selection 
Path 
Path 
Iteration 

One showing where the student-developed procedure is being called. 

#### Questions 2
Answer in total of 200 words:
- Describe in general what the identified procedure does and how it contributes to the overall functionality of the program. 

- Explain in detailed steps how the algorithm implemented in the identified procedure works. Your explanation must be detailed enough for someone else to recreate it. 


- Call 1 
    - Describe a call to the procedure identified in written response Row 4 and 5. Include the argument passed for the call and the path evoked by the call. 
    - Describe what condition(s) in being tested by the call to the procedure. 	
    - Identify the result of the call. 
	

 
- Call 2 
    - Describe a call to the procedure identified in written response Row 4 and 5. Include the argument passed for the call and the path evoked by the call.
    - Describe what condition(s) in being tested by the call to the procedure. 
	- Identify the result of the call. 
	

 



### EXAM
Thursday, May 14, 2026 - 12pm
3 hours


Section I: End-of-Course Multiple-Choice Exam

70 multiple-choice questions | 120 minutes | 70% of score | 4 answer options

    57 single-select multiple-choice 
    5 single-select with reading passage about a computing innovation 
    8 multiple-select multiple-choice: select 2 answers 

 

The AP Computer Science Principles end-of-course exam has consistent question types, weighting, and scoring guidelines every year, so you know what to expect on exam day.  
Section II: Create Performance Task

30% of score

    Create performance task program code, video, and student-authored Personalized Project Reference | 9 hours in-class
    2 written response questions | 60 minutes end-of-course exam 

The second section of the AP Computer Science Principles Exam consists of a through-course Create performance task where you will develop a computer program of your choice an end-of-course written response section where you will demonstrate your understanding of your Create performance task by answering four prompts. You will be provided 9 hours of in-class time to complete your program, video, and develop a Personalized Project Reference.  

On the end-of-course exam, you will respond to two questions related to the code in your Personalized Project Reference. The two questions include four distinct prompts: Written Response 1, Written Response 2(a), Written Response 2(b), and Written Response 2(c). You will have access to your Personalized Project Reference while responding to these prompts. The four categories listed below align to the four prompts.


### TODO
Bluebook exam practice (Preview tests are partial exams and are not timed and not scored.)
Take ID to exam
