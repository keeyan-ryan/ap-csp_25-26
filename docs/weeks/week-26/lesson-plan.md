# Week 26 — MakeCode CSP Wrapper

Primary lesson (MakeCode)
- Use: Create PT — Build Sprint 4
  https://microsoft.github.io/makecode-csp
- Editor: Browser-based; toggle “Show Python” where available.

Phase focus
- Create PT Build (≥9 in‑class hrs overall)

In-class (teacher)
- Orient students to the week’s MakeCode page(s); model small change → test → iterate.
- Cold-call 1–2 quick checks aligned to AP pseudocode (DISPLAY → print, REPEAT → loops).
- If applicable to Create PT weeks: checkpoint list use and a student-developed procedure with parameter(s).

In-class (student)
- Complete the week’s MakeCode tasks and at least one extension.
- Save/share project link; note one bug fixed and how.

Homework (≈120–180 min)
- Finish MakeCode tasks; complete one extension.
- AP Classroom (15–20 min): Create PT rubric language; abstraction/list requirements
- Barron’s (20–30 min): Create PT guidelines and exemplars

Self-study (optional, 15–30 min)
- AP Daily: AP Daily: Create PT tips/exemplars

Checks and deliverables
- Mini-quiz (6–8 min): 3–4 items (pseudocode→Python, trace, concept check).
- Submit: MakeCode project link + 3–5 bullet reflection.

Notes (moved from this-week.md)

- Phase focus: Create PT Build (≥9 in‑class hrs overall)
- In-class: model “small change → test → iterate”; cold‑call pseudocode checks (DISPLAY → print; REPEAT → loops).
- Quick checks: parameter vs argument; return vs print; list traversal; input validation (as relevant).
- Assess: mini‑quiz (6–8 min) — pseudocode→Python, trace, concept check; AP Classroom completion check.


## Teacher prep (before class)
- Review and merge student PRs for Week 26 on GitHub (ensure checks pass).
- Sync local repo:
  - git checkout main && git pull
- Generate a quick summary of student links and before‑class notes (optional):
  - bash scripts/collect_week_submissions.sh 26 > /tmp/week-26-summary.md
  - Open /tmp/week-26-summary.md during class for quick access to links.
- Verify this week’s docs are live:
  - Plan: {{ site.baseurl }}/weeks/week-26/this-week.html
  - Quiz: {{ site.baseurl }}/weeks/week-26/quiz.html

## How to use this week
- In class: pick a short code.org App Lab level for variables or conditionals as a live demo; use one CFU as the exit ticket.
- After class: 2–4 code.org levels + AP Daily clips; Barron’s Quick Quiz for the assigned reading.
- Periodic: every 3–4 weeks, pull a Barron’s mini set as a timed check.
