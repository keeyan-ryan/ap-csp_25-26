# Week 1 — MakeCode CSP Wrapper

Primary lesson (MakeCode)
- Use: Unit 1, Day 1 — Intro to AP CSP
  https://microsoft.github.io/makecode-csp/unit-1/day-1/intro-ap-csp
- Editor: Browser-based; toggle “Show Python” where available.

Phase focus
- Foundations (Programming/CRD/AAP/DAT)

In-class (teacher)
- Orient students to the week’s MakeCode page(s); model small change → test → iterate.
- Cold-call 1–2 quick checks aligned to AP pseudocode (DISPLAY → print, REPEAT → loops).
- If applicable to Create PT weeks: checkpoint list use and a student-developed procedure with parameter(s).

In-class (student)
- Complete the week’s MakeCode tasks and at least one extension.
- Save/share project link; note one bug fixed and how.

Homework (≈120–180 min)
- Finish MakeCode tasks; complete one extension.
- AP Classroom (15–20 min): CRD 1.1; AAP basics (variables, conditionals, loops)
- Barron’s (20–30 min): About the AP CSP Exam; Programming Fundamentals

Self-study (optional, 15–30 min)
- AP Daily: AP Daily clips on variables, conditionals, loops, procedures, lists

Checks and deliverables
- Mini-quiz (6–8 min): 3–4 items (pseudocode→Python, trace, concept check).
- Submit: MakeCode project link + 3–5 bullet reflection.

TOOD:
- []  Compare AP Daily to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs58aO6XczY&list=PLoGgviqq4844vbwcKegJgIxSQyVHDzSXT
- [ ] extra support here worth it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHSokBrStpQ&list=PLoGgviqq48452kiJGcpqKhgNuPFDahbaS
- chec the note folder Teachers notes and study plan, some solid pdfs I should read


# Teacher Lesson Plan — Week 1

Focus
- Foundations (Programming/CRD/AAP/DAT)

In-class guidance
- Model “small change → test → iterate”; cold‑call pseudocode checks (DISPLAY → print; REPEAT → loops).

Quick checks
- Parameter vs argument; return vs print; list traversal; input validation (as relevant).

Assess
- Mini‑quiz (6–8 min) — pseudocode→Python, trace, concept check; AP Classroom completion check.
