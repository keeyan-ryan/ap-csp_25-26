title: Week 10 — Lesson Plan
---
{% include topnav.md %}


Notes (moved from this-week.md)

- Phase focus: Foundations (Programming/CRD/AAP/DAT)
- In-class: model “small change → test → iterate”; cold‑call pseudocode checks (DISPLAY → print; REPEAT → loops).
- Quick checks: parameter vs argument; return vs print; list traversal; input validation (as relevant).
- Assess: mini‑quiz (6–8 min) — pseudocode→Python, trace, concept check; AP Classroom completion check.


## Teacher prep (before class)
- Review and merge student PRs for Week 10 on GitHub (ensure checks pass).
- Sync local repo:
  - git checkout main && git pull
- Generate a quick summary of student links and before‑class notes (optional):
  - bash scripts/collect_week_submissions.sh 10 > /tmp/week-10-summary.md
  - Open /tmp/week-10-summary.md during class for quick access to links.
- Verify this week’s docs are live:
  - Plan: {{ site.baseurl }}/weeks/week-10/this-week.html
  - Quiz: {{ site.baseurl }}/weeks/week-10/quiz.html

## How to use this week
- In class: pick a short code.org App Lab level for variables or conditionals as a live demo; use one CFU as the exit ticket.
- After class: 2–4 code.org levels + AP Daily clips; Barron’s Quick Quiz for the assigned reading.
- Periodic: every 3–4 weeks, pull a Barron’s mini set as a timed check.
