# Week 8: This Week in AP CSP

Before class (10–20 min)
- Barron’s: Lists/Strings; Tracing & Debugging
- Optional: AP Daily — AP Daily clips on variables, conditionals, loops, procedures, lists

In class (60–90 min)
- MakeCode CSP: Unit 1 — Debugging/Testing
  https://microsoft.github.io/makecode-csp
- Focus: Debugging and test ideas
- Do: complete all activities and one extension; save/share the project link.

After class (120–180 min)
- Finish MakeCode tasks and one extension (document which one).
- AP Classroom Topic Questions (15–20 min): AAP‑2.* (lists, traversals), code analysis
- Reading (20–30 min): Barron’s — Lists/Strings; Tracing & Debugging
- Reflection (5–10 min): 3–5 bullets — one benefit and one risk (IOC).

Deliverables
- MakeCode project link(s) + 3–5 bullet reflection.

Due
- Start of next class: ______ (insert date/time).

Teacher notes
- Phase focus: Foundations (Programming/CRD/AAP/DAT)
- In-class: model “small change → test → iterate”; cold‑call pseudocode checks (DISPLAY → print; REPEAT → loops).
- Quick checks: parameter vs argument; return vs print; list traversal; input validation (as relevant).
- Assess: mini‑quiz (6–8 min) — pseudocode→Python, trace, concept check; AP Classroom completion check.
