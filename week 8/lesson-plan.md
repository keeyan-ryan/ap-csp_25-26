- Save/share project link; note one bug fixed and how.

Homework (≈120–180 min)
- Finish MakeCode tasks; complete one extension.
- AP Classroom (15–20 min): AAP‑2.* (lists, traversals), Code analysis
- Barron’s (20–30 min): Lists/Strings; Tracing & Debugging

Self-study (optional, 15–30 min)
- AP Daily: AP Daily clips on variables, conditionals, loops, procedures, lists

Checks and deliverables
- Mini-quiz (6–8 min): 3–4 items (pseudocode→Python, trace, concept check).
