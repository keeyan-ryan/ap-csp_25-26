# Week 01 — Answer Key (Variables/Conditionals)

Q1. Predict output
- Evaluate variable updates in order, then take the IF/ELSE branch based on the final condition. Answer is the value printed after the branch. Show the branch taken.

Q2. AP pseudocode → Python
- DISPLAY(x) → print(x)
- INPUT() → input() (cast with int(...) if numeric)
- SET x ← 5 → x = 5

Q3. Bug hunt
- Common fixes: use == instead of = in conditionals; indent blocks consistently; compare like types (e.g., int vs string); initialize variables before use.

Q4. Variable vs constant
- Use a constant for values that don’t change (e.g., MAX_SCORE); use a variable for values updated at runtime (e.g., total).
