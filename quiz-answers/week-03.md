# Week 03 â€” Answer Key (Loops/Patterns)

Q1. REPEAT n TIMES
- Body runs n times; count from 1..n in AP pseudocode. Output shows n lines/iterations.

Q2. Condition-controlled loop
- Count iterations until condition becomes false; show invariant changing each step.

Q3. Accumulator
- Initialize total once; add inside loop; final total equals initial + sum of updates.

Q4. Choice of loop
- Counted loop for known iteration counts; condition-controlled loop when exit depends on data/input.
