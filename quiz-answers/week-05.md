# Week 05 — Answer Key (Lists/Arrays)

Q1. Indexing
- In AP pseudocode, indexing is 1-based. For L ← [3,5,7], L[2] is 5.

Q2. Valid operations
- APPEND(L, x), INSERT(L, i, x), REMOVE(L, i), LENGTH(L), x IN L are valid.

Q3. Loop trace
- Iterate i from 1..LENGTH(L); use L[i] for element; show printed sequence.

Q4. Off-by-one errors
- Common mistakes: starting at 0; using LENGTH(L)-1; exceeding LENGTH(L).
