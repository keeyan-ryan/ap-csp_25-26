# Week 18 — MakeCode CSP Wrapper

Primary lesson (MakeCode)
- Use: Mini‑Project — Integrate Lists + Procedures
  https://microsoft.github.io/makecode-csp
- Editor: Browser-based; toggle “Show Python” where available.

Phase focus
- Algorithms/Abstraction + Mini‑projects

In-class (teacher)
- Orient students to the week’s MakeCode page(s); model small change → test → iterate.
- Cold-call 1–2 quick checks aligned to AP pseudocode (DISPLAY → print, REPEAT → loops).
- If applicable to Create PT weeks: checkpoint list use and a student-developed procedure with parameter(s).

In-class (student)
- Complete the week’s MakeCode tasks and at least one extension.
- Save/share project link; note one bug fixed and how.

Homework (≈120–180 min)
- Finish MakeCode tasks; complete one extension.
- AP Classroom (15–20 min): AAP‑3.*; Code analysis; Abstraction rationale
- Barron’s (20–30 min): Algorithms & Code Analysis

Self-study (optional, 15–30 min)
- AP Daily: AP Daily: Abstraction & Code Analysis

Checks and deliverables
- Mini-quiz (6–8 min): 3–4 items (pseudocode→Python, trace, concept check).
- Submit: MakeCode project link + 3–5 bullet reflection.
