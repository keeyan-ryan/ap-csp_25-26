sampling is converting an analog signal to a digital one (p150)
analog data has values that change smoothly over time and are continuous signals (p150)
digital data is a analog signal that has been broken up into steps and are discreet time signals (p150)
abstraction are when bits are grouped to find common fetures and can shrink the size of the code (p149)

Analog and Digital:
: Analog data has values that change smoothly over time and are continuous signals (p150)
: Digital data is a analog signal that has been broken up into steps and are discreet time signals (p150)


Abstraction:
: Are when bits are grouped to find common fetures and can shrink the size of the code (p149)
