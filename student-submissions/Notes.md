## Binary 
- maxiumum states `2^n`
- highest value it can represent: `2^n - 1`

## Program ideas

## Key terms

- ==sampling== is converting an analog signal to a digital one (p150)
- ==analog== data has values that change smoothly over time and are continuous signals (p150)
- ==digital== data is a analog signal that has been broken up into steps and are discreet time signals (p150)
- ==abstraction== ~are when bits are grouped to find common fetures and can shrink the size of the code (p149)~
- ==abstraction== is a simplified representation of something complex that hides unnecessary details, allowing us to focus on high-level operations or ideas.
- ==bit== (binary digit) is a single unit of information in a computer, typically represented as a 0 or 1.
- ==Binary== is a way of representing information using only two options.
- ==Lossless compression== reduces file size without losing any information. The original data can be perfectly reconstructed.
- ==Lossy compressi reduces file size by removing some data, resulting in a loss of quality. The original data cannot be perfectly restored.
