All computers: input-->store-->process-->output



# Stuff to remember
-  computing device is a physical artifact that can run a program. Some examples include computers, tablets, servers, routers, and smart sensors.
- Computers use binary because their hardware is based on two states (on/off), making it efficient to store and process all types of data, including images and text, as sequences of 0s and 1s.


- A single effect can be viewed as both beneficial and harmful by different people, or even by the same person.

## Binary 
- maxiumum states `2^n` or  ${2^n}$

- highest value it can represent: `2^n - 1` ${{2^n}-1}$

## Key terms

Sampling ‼️  IMPROVE ‼️ 
> is converting an analog signal to a digital one (p150)

Analog data  〰️ 
> has values that change smoothly over time and are continuous signals (p150)

Digital 1️⃣ / 0️⃣ 
>  data is a analog signal that has been broken up into steps and are discreet time signals (p150)

Abstraction 📚 
>  ~are when bits are grouped to find common fetures and can shrink the size of the code (p149)~
> is a simplified representation of something complex that hides unnecessary details, allowing us to focus on high-level operations or ideas.

Binary 1️⃣0️⃣0️⃣1️⃣
> is a way of representing information using only two options.

Bit 0️⃣
> (binary digit) is a single unit of information in a computer, typically represented as a 0 or 1.

Lossless compression  🌕
> reduces file size without losing any information. The original data can be perfectly reconstructed.

Lossy compression 🌔
> reduces file size by removing some data, resulting in a loss of quality. The original data cannot be perfectly restored.



intellectual property 
> any intangible creations of the mind, such as inventions, artistic works, designs, brand names, and symbols.

creative commons 
> a license that allows you to freely use materials created by others.

ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) 
>  a character encoding standard that assigns numbers to letters, digits, and symbols so computers can represent and process text.

A pixel 
> the smallest unit of a digital image, representing a single point of color or shade.

bitmap 
> a way of representing an image as a grid of pixels, where each pixel’s value is stored in binary. For black and white images, each pixel is typically 1 bit.

RGB 
> stands for Red, Green, Blue. In digital images, each pixel’s color is created by combining different intensities of these three colors, usually with 8 bits per channel.

Computing Device
> electronic machines that perform tasks automatically by executing instructions, enabling them to process, store, and analyze data

Computing System
> a combination of physical components (hardware) and instructions (software) that work together to perform tasks, such as receiving, storing, processing, and transmitting information

Computing Network
> a collection of two or more interconnected computing devices that share data, resources, and services using physical or wireless connections and agreed-upon communication protocols

Path
> a string of characters that specifies the unique location of a file, directory, or other resource within a file system or a hierarchical structure

Bandwidth
> the maximum theoretical amount of data that can be transmitted over a communication channel within a given period of time, typically measured in bits per second (bps)
