sampling is converting an analog signal to a digital one (p150).
analog data has values that change smoothly over time and are continuous signals (p150).
digital data is a analog signal that has been broken up into steps and are discreet time signals (p150).
abstraction is a simplified representation of something complex that hides unnecessary details, allowing us to focus on high-level operations or ideas.
a bit (binary digit) is a single unit of information in a computer, typically represented as a 0 or 1.
Binary is a way of representing information using only two options.
Lossless compression reduces file size without losing any information. The original data can be perfectly reconstructed.
Lossy compression reduces file size by removing some data, resulting in a loss of quality. The original data cannot be perfectly restored.

Sampling:
: Converting an analog signal to a digital one (p150)

Analog and Digital:
: Analog data has values that change smoothly over time and are continuous signals (p150)
: Digital data is a analog signal that has been broken up into steps and are discreet time signals (p150)


Abstraction:
: Are when bits are grouped to find common fetures and can shrink the size of the code (p149)
