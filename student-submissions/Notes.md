sampling is converting an analog signal to a digital one (p150).
analog data has values that change smoothly over time and are continuous signals (p150).
digital data is a analog signal that has been broken up into steps and are discreet time signals (p150).
abstraction is a simplified representation of something complex that hides unnecessary details, allowing us to focus on high-level operations or ideas.
a bit (binary digit) is a single unit of information in a computer, typically represented as a 0 or 1.
Binary is a way of representing information using only two options.
Lossless compression reduces file size without losing any information. The original data can be perfectly reconstructed.
Lossy compression reduces file size by removing some data, resulting in a loss of quality. The original data cannot be perfectly restored.
intellectual property is any intangible creations of the mind, such as inventions, artistic works, designs, brand names, and symbols.
creative commons is a license that allows you to freely use materials created by others.
ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) is a character encoding standard that assigns numbers to letters, digits, and symbols so computers can represent and process text.
A pixel is the smallest unit of a digital image, representing a single point of color or shade.
Computers use binary because their hardware is based on two states (on/off), making it efficient to store and process all types of data, including images and text, as sequences of 0s and 1s.
A bitmap is a way of representing an image as a grid of pixels, where each pixel’s value is stored in binary. For black and white images, each pixel is typically 1 bit.
RGB stands for Red, Green, Blue. In digital images, each pixel’s color is created by combining different intensities of these three colors, usually with 8 bits per channel.
